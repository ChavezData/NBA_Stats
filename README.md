## Motivation

Understanding NBA statistics can provide insights into team performance, player efficiency, trends over time, and predictive relationships. The goal of this project is to:

1. Gather and clean NBA data (team & player stats)  
2. Explore the data to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends  
3. Engineer meaningful features  
4. Build and evaluate predictive/statistical models (e.g. for team wins, player performance)  
5. Derive insights about what metrics matter in a 2023 context
